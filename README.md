# About the Econonetwork
#### Last updated: February 2026

## Why?

Economists, like any other discipline, do not produce ideas in a vacuum. Their contributions build upon and influence one another, forming a complex and evolving web of intellectual history. The goal of this project is to uncover and visualize those interconnections—academic lineage, intellectual influence, and institutional affiliations—using structured data scraped from Wikipedia.

Inspired by projects that have done similar work in philosophy, this effort brings the tools of data scraping, transformation, and network analysis to the history of economic thought. While some similar projects exist, they often focus on either manual curation or simple lists. Here, we aim to automate the data collection process at scale and create a reusable foundation for further historical, institutional, or theoretical investigations into the economics profession.


## How?

## Disclaimer

This project is subject to a number of limitations:
- It is based solely on the English-language Wikipedia (WikiData) and its editorial choices
- Some economists do not have structured or complete infobox data
- The scraper relies on heuristic parsing and may introduce noise

Despite these caveats, the resulting dataset offers a compelling and scalable lens into the development of economic ideas and the scholars behind them. Use with curiosity and caution.
